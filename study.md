# Full Stack Project Practice

Please be prepared to discuss these items with a consultant during a 1 on 1.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

An app to share and rate movies with friends.  We value the opinions of our friends over the general public at large.  This app would hopefully lead to better movie choices because you can see the ratings of people you know. Groups of friends who want to share info about what they are watching and enjoying.
## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

1. As a user, I want to see what movies my friends add.
2. As a user, I want to add movies to the dataset.
3. As a user, I want to rate movies in the list.
4. As a user, I want to see my friends ratings.
5. As a user, I want to choose which facebook friends I connect with.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

movie title | user rating | friend1 rating |friend2 rating| friend n rating
----------------------------------------------------------------
Star Wars   | * * * * *   | * * * *        |              | * * * * *
Alien       | * * *       | * * *          | * * * * *    |
Intergalacti|             | * * * * *      |              | * * * * *

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

At this time, I don't know that I will need more than 1 table.

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?
POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE??

## 3rd Party APIs

Possibly facebook, so that you can easily include people you are already friends with.  I really don't know anything about how that works.

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.
